# Column Explanations

### Name/Alias

Contains the most usual name(s) for the product, except when the `--full` flag was specified during generation, which will make it include all names.

### Maker(s)

States who are either the current maintainers of the project, or, if it entered the public domain, the original makers of the project.

### Description/Notes

Some extra information about a codec, which might contain some very important information, though often just some extra info.

### (Ecosystem) Support (%)

How many devices can on average play it back. This is an estimate, based on questions like these (in descending order of importance):
1. How many OSes support it natively?
2. Is it supported in major web browsers?
3. Do Smart TVs, game consoles, and streaming boxes support it?
4. Is it supported in major NLEs like Premiere and Resolve?
5. Can play-it-all players like VLC or FFplay play it without extra installs?

### Lossy/Lossless Size (%)

States what the relative size is to either...
- the entry with a size of 100% in the case of Lossy
- an uncompressed version of the media in the case of Lossless

So, for example, if H.264 is 100% and H.265 is 50%, to get a video in both codecs to look the same, you'd need a 40 MB H.264 file or a 20 MB H.265 file.

### Decode/Encode Speed (%)

Uses the same relative system as Lossy/Lossless Size: the higher the percentage, the faster it decodes/encodes. Does not take hardware coders into account.

### License

Shows the type of license under which a codec is released. For specific information, I highly recommend you look up what the actual specific license for your codec of interest is.

### Year

The year in which the codec specifications were finalised.
