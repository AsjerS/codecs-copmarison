# Codecs Comparison

A detailed comparison of most major codecs for video, audio, image, and more. Some data, like file size, are estimates, not actual values, since those depend on how something is decoded. It's made to be as consistent as I could make it, while still being easy to read. For example, JPEG lossless compression has a value going over 100%, because it's almost never used and makes the other values clearer.

## File Explanation

- **`database.sql`**: The script used to generate the database in SQLite, where all the data is stored initially.
- **`table_generators/markdown.py`**: The script that generates a customizable Markdown version of the comparison from `codecs.db`.

## Build Your Own

To make your own version of the table, follow these steps:

1. Install SQLite and Python on your system.
2. Copy this repository: `git clone https://github.com/AsjerS/codecs-copmarison.git`.
3. CD into the repository, and generate `codecs.db` with `sqlite3 codecs.db < databse.sql`.
4. CD into `table_generators/`, and edit the `webtables.py` configuration to your liking.
5. Run `webtables.py` with your flags of choice, explained here:
- Controlling types of tables:
    - for a simple Markdown table: `--format simple-md` (or `-f simple-md`)
    - for a Markdown table with extra formatting for GitHub: `-format github-md`
    - for an HTML table: `--format html`
- Selecting the amount of data:
    - for just the essential data: `--relevance 1` (or `-r 1`)
    - for all the data you're most likely to encounter: `--relevance 2`
    - for everything in the database, including extremely niche data: `--relevance 3`
- Choosing whether you want to show all aliases of codecs: `--show-aliases` (or `-a`)

There is a ton of data in the database that's unused in the version on this page, so you could make your own table however you'd like. When I find the time for it I might also make a GUI application for generating these tables.

## Markdown Version

Note: this is a heavily stripped down version of the comparison, only containing the codecs you're most likely to find on the web.

There is a version with all codecs existing in the database named `full_version.md`, though this is mostly just for easily previewing what data there is in the database without installing anything.
