<h1>Encoding/Decoding Basics</h1>
<p>When computers first became popular for viewing media, most video was stored uncompressed. This means the video files were quite large, often needing to be stored on huge discs like the LaserDisc (which looks like a big CD), which was the first commercially available digital home video format.</p>
<p>They quickly realised that this was a very impractical way of storing digital video, so companies began researching a way to get more video while storing less data. which they did with something called compression.</p>
<p>For basic, lossless compression (meaning no data is actually lost), they used algorithms that detected how to store data more efficiently. A very basic example of such an algorithm is this: say you have to store the data "555999222333" (note: video and audio data is also just data like these numbers, it's just abstracted here for easier explaining). This is a big piece of text, but you could compress it by storing it as "3*5 3*9 3*2 3*3". This is still inefficient, so you could make a simple rule: the first digit is always the multiplier for the second digit. This would become: "35 39 32 33", but the spaces are redundant, so: "35393233". What we have just done was *encoding* (also called coding): making data smaller following a set of rules.</p>
<p>This is smaller than what we started with, but if you show this to someone, they'd have no idea how to read it properly. For this we need a *decoder*. A decoder is a set of instructions for how to convert the encoded data into the original data. The instructions for this would be something like "every other digit should be multiplied by the digit right behind it" (basically what we just did for encoding but in reverse). By letting someone (/a computer) follow those instructions, they'd be able to convert "35393233" to "3*5 3*9 3*2 3*3" back to "555999222333"</p>
<p>With what we just did, we could recreate the original/raw data perfectly from the encoded data. But most video/audio codecs don't do this: they discard some of the original data during the encoding process to save drastically more space, using advanced algorithms to remove the exact data you're most unlikely to notice missing. Once the data is encoded though, the decoding will always get you the same result, because the encoded data doesn't change anymore once it's made.</p>
<p>Those set of rules for how to encode and decode data is called a *codec* (COderDECoder). Codecs like these you might've heard of are H.264, HEVC, JPEG, PNG, MP3, AAC, etc., which is what the table goes in depth about, as they all have different properties, like what kind of data they're made to code, how efficient they are at that, whether they're paid (because the algorithms are so advanced they can be copyrighted), how hard it is to encode/decode, whether they discard data or not, etc.</p>
