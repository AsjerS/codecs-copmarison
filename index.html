<h1>Encoding/Decoding Basics</h1>
<p>When computers first became popular for viewing media, most video was stored uncompressed. This means the video files were extremely big, as they stored the exact colour of each pixel tens of times per second, meaning the average film would take over 300 DVDs of storage, and even then it wouldn't be that high quality.</p>
<p>There were only a few methods of storing so much video, like the D-1 Tape, though they quickly realised that this was a very impractical way of storing digital video, so companies and institutes began researching a way to get more video while storing less data, which they did with something called compression.</p>
<p>The most basic kind of compression is lossless compression, meaining no data is lost during compression. A very basic example of an algorithm to do lossless compression is this: say you have to store the data "AAA BBBBB CCCC". Instead of literally writing that, we could set up a rule that any repeating letters could be written as just the number of times it repeats (e.g "EEE" becomes "3E"). That would make it "3A 5B 4C" . What we have just done is *encoding* (also called coding): making data smaller by following a set of rules.</p>
<p>We now have "3A 5B 4C", but if you show this to someone, they'd have no idea how to convert it back to just letters. For this we need a *decoder*. A decoder is a set of instructions for how to convert the encoded data into the original data. Those instructions here would be "multiply each letter by the number before it". By letting someone (/a computer) follow those instructions, they'd be able to convert "3A 5B 4C" back to "AAA BBBBB CCCC" to display it.</p>
<p>With what we just did, we could already saving a moderate amount of space. But for the average video and way more advanced algorithms, it would still take roughly 150 DVDs to store one film, so most audio/video codecs do something different: they throw away a ton of data you're most unlikely to notice missing. (chroma subsampling example?) Once the data is encoded though, the decoding will always get you the same result, because the encoded data doesn't change anymore once it's made.</p>
<p>Those set of rules for how to encode and decode data is called a *codec* (COderDECoder). Codecs like these you might've heard of are H.264, HEVC, JPEG, PNG, MP3, AAC, etc., which is what the table goes in depth about, as they all have different properties, like what kind of data they're made to code, how efficient they are at that, whether they're paid (because the algorithms are so advanced they can be copyrighted), how hard it is to encode/decode, whether they discard data or not, etc.</p>
